There's been some recent brouhaha over how ["air travel was exciting"](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/25-photos-from-golden-age-of-aviation-2013-7?op=1#passengers-aboard-a-boeing-747-enjoy-the-spacious-economy-class-configuration-date-unknown-24) and glamours in the '50s and '60s. Which isn't, of course, a [new complaint](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704684604575380992283473182). But it is [rubbish](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3022215/terminal-velocity/what-it-was-really-like-to-fly-during-the-golden-age-of-travel#3). It was boring, smoky, dangerous, noisy, and drunken.

But the legroom! The [touch of class](http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-AW097_MIDSEA_DV_20100721200627.jpg)! Airport queues were not an [ordeal](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/tsa). Well, actually, you can have that now. But let me take you on a little trip first.

### Sydney to London

It is Monday December 1st, 1947 and a QANTAS [Lockheed Constellation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Constellation) is preparing to leave Sydney airport. It's destination is London, via the [Kangaroo Route](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_Route). This is the first time a 'direct' flight has been available from Sydney to London. Before now, QANTAS flew to Singapore, and from there you could take a [Empire Airways](http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/complete/qf39) flight to London. Today there are just 29 passengers, and 11 crew, and they're leaving at [22.30](http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/complete/qf48/qf48-2.jpg).

It will take them nearly four days. You see, the plane can't fly well at night, and it needs to refuel regularly. So they'll be stopping in [Darwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory), [Singapore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore), [Karachi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi), [Cairo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo), [Castel Benito](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castel_Benito) (Tripoli), and London. They'll spend the nights in Singapore, Karachi, and Cairo.

Six years later, in 1953 this same trip will be leaving [every day except Sunday](http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/complete/qf53/qf53-2.jpg) and cost [£529 4s](http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/complete/qf53/qf53-6.jpg) (that's British pounds, not Australian). The [cabin](http://www.aussieairliners.org/l-1049/vh-eab2/1802.113.html) looks rather like a [Dash-8](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brandon301095/6837910940/).

A flight cost of just £529 4s? Well, that's in 1953. That's equivalent to [£12,500](http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/result.php?use%5B%5D=CPI&use%5B%5D=NOMINALEARN&year_early=1953&pound71=529&shilling71=4&pence71=&amount=529.2&year_source=1953&year_result=2012) today, equal to $23,650 AUD, or $20,750 USD.

Okay, so not many people could pay that! Clearly only the [Queen](http://www.aussieairliners.org/l-1049/vh-eaf/1802.072.html) and other [VIPs](http://www.aussieairliners.org/l-1049/vh-eag/1802.084.html) were flying.

In [1963](http://www.aussieairliners.org/l-1049/vh-eag/1802.084.html) there were two classes, and flying the much improved [Boeing 707 Jet](http://www.aussieairliners.org/b-707q/vh-eba/4604.846.html) the flight time was down to [less than two days](http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/complete/qf63/qf63-03.jpg), since no overnight stops were required. But the price of a return Economy ticket was still high at £471.40, or [£8,350.00](http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/result.php?use%5B%5D=CPI&use%5B%5D=NOMINALEARN&year_early=1963&pound71=471&shilling71=4&pence71=&amount=471.2&year_source=1963&year_result=2012) in today's money (AUD $15,750).

These days QF1/2 is a Airbus A380-800, with a refuel in Dubai. It takes less than 24 hours. And a return Economy airfare can be had for $3,000. A *First Class* airfare is $13,500. And First Class in [2014](http://boardingarea.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/onemileatatime/files/2013/02/IMG_2188.jpg) is a lot nicer than Economy in the '50s and '60s.

### Sydney to Melbourne

Not all of us are jet-setting across the world. Sometimes you just need to be at a wedding one state away, and you'd rather not drive for eight hours straight. Fair enough, you're not alone. The route between Sydney and Melbourne is the [5th busiest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World's_busiest_passenger_air_routes) in the world. Maybe you're budget concious too, so you're going to fly ANSETT.

Did you just do a double-take? Yes, ANSETT. It's 1949, and the flight leaves at [3.10 PM](http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/complete/an49/an49-2.jpg), there will be a stop in Wagga at around 4.30 and you'll arrive at 6.20 pm (none of this 24 hour nonsense thank you). A return flight costs just £13 (that's Australian pounds), and it's a [Douglas Airliner](http://www.aussieairliners.org/dc-3/vh-anh/0250.127.html).

That's [$650](http://www.rba.gov.au/calculator/annualPreDecimal.html) today.

Today the flight time is an hour and a half, and the cost goes from about $125 return (JetStar) to $450 at peak times (QANTAS). There's over 90 flights each way per day.
