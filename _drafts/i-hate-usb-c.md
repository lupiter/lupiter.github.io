# Point the First: Mystery Meat

Can you tell the difference between a USB-C port and a Thunderbolt 3 port? How fast can this USB brick charge my laptop? If I connect these two devices, will either charge the other? Can they talk to eachother? Will it be recognised as a display, or a drive, or a hub? How fast are the ports on this dongle?

# Point the Second: A Square Peg in A Round Hole

It's still to hard to line up plug and port in the dark. It's too easy to pull at an odd angle and damage the port or the cable. You can crush the cable end by droping something on it.

USB-C is worse than both Lightning and Magsafe. You can actually get USB-C cables with a tiny nub on one end that you're supposed to leave in the device which is then magnetically connected to the cable. You know. Like Magsafe.

# Point the Third: Everything Is Breaking

There are no good dongles. There are some dongles that are sometimes not garbage. 

I paid $100 for a USB-C to HDMI adaptor that doesn't work with my iPad, but does work with my laptop. I have an Apple USB-C to HDMI adaptor that now stops working after 30 minutes of continuous use. I have a cheap kmart USB-C to HDMI adaptor that works great when you hold the cable at just the right angle. I have a satechi combo two-port adaptor where the ethernet isn't even gigabit.

Don't even joke about thunderbolt dongles.

# Point the Fourth: We Were Promised Jetpacks

USB-A and micro ports and cables break from being shoved in wrong. HDMI ports and cables have a standards confusion problem. Thunderbolt is really expensive and the cables are really short. 

The USB-C connector doesn't solve these problems. The only advantage it offers over previous USB ports and plugs is that it solves the problem with USB-A where you'd have to try three times to plug it in.

It's actively worse than previous built-in headphone jacks and SD card readers.

We were sold on USB-C as "one plug to connect everything" that's nice and reversable and easy to use. It only connects some things, occasionally, it's fragile, and not that easy to use.

Oh, and we were promised hubs. One port and we'd be connecting 127 devices. Just like you could with old USB if you could find a hub that would also give sufficient power. Yeah right.

# Point the Fifth: Everyone's Future Isn't Wireless

I carefuly align my iPhone, in its case with a popsocket, on a Qi charger by my bed. It's not really better than a cable, and sometimes I bump the phone ever so slightly in my sleep and it doesn't charge overnight.

I have a big camera. It has a wifi transfer that is slow as molases and requires connecting your device to an unsecured wifi network that the camera generates and which drains the camera's battery very quickly. Or pop out the SD card, which can be ready very quickly... if you have a 2015 MacBook Pro, or a lightning SD card reader. Not if you're daisy-chaining dongles to an iPad with USB-C.

AirPlay is fine to show a video or slideshow on your TV. It's not fast enough to use as an extra monitor.

My computer keyboard and trackpad are both bluetooth. The former is always connected by cable because then I don't have to worry about battiers. It lives on my desk all the time, cables aren't a problem. The trackpad can't be plugged in and I have a near-permanent "low battery" notification on my monitor.

Cables are faster and more reliable than wireless solutions.

# I Don't Want More USB-C

Maybe someone at Intel is right now designing the Next Great Cable. Maybe it's someone at Apple, or Google, or even Microsoft. I welcome it with open arms. We haven't even fully entered the USB-C age and I can't wait to leave it.
