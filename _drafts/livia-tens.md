I first learned about TENS, or to call it by it's full name, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation watching [One Born Every Minute](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1623135/), which is not a show I recommend if you're squeemish but is a show I recommend if you want to learn about how, in this day and age, babies get outside the womb. In the UK version they introduce TENS as a 'no-drug' form of pain relief.

TENS isn't a new technology, I guess in some ways it's the great-grandchild of those weirdos like John Wesley trying out 'electricity' as a treatment for just about everything. What we have left is ECT and TENS.

My journey with TENS devices began about a year and a half ago when I started having really painful periods again. Initially I just took more NSAIDs and used heat packs. Then I tried stronger NSAIDs. I got a script for double-dose ibuprofen. I got a script for some opioids after specifically asking the doctor not to give me opioids because I don't like how they make me feel. And I guess after a lot of searching online for anything else that might help, Instagram's weirdly precise ad tracking recommended Livia.

Livia doesn't sell itself as TENS, so I was initially highly sceptical. "Instant, drug-free relief from menstrual cramps" sounds like snake oil or maybe injection opioids. At over $200 AUD it looked exactly like a scam preying on people who will do anything to get a bit of relief from cramps.

I started searching around and I found some reviews that pointed out that Livia was basically a fancy, expensive, TENS device. Once I knew that, I knew that this wasn't a essential-oils-cure-cancer rubbish. So I went looking for the research, and sure enough it's there. TENS is safe, has no side-effects, and works for most people (not everyone) for period pain relief. It's not as good as Livia are claiming, but it's not garbage.

So I went out and bought a TENS machine. Not a Livia, no way. I got the [PainMate](https://www.priceline.com.au/painmate-tens-device-1-ea) on sale for $20. It takes coin cell batteries, and can only run for about 10 minutes. It will run through the batteries even when off. It's not *good* but for $20 it was *good enough* to find out if TENS was going to do anything at all for me.
