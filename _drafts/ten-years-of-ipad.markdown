It's now been ten years since the introduction of the iPad, and [people]() [have]() [feelings](). I agree with a lot of them. The iPad is a glorious success, but it hasn't reached a fraction of it's potential. The iPad has grown so much in ten years, but it still feels crippled. The iPad is amazing and constantly frustrating. I love my iPad and would be devastated to loose it, but I still need a Mac for many things where I feel like I shouldn't.

# What _is_ a computer?

Towards the end of 2017, Apple made an ad for the iPad Pro that asked [what's a computer](https://ww.9to5mac.com/9:jQA0lQV6Uh85mP81kFOsUvWekB8hVMN3UiNgUiN2U2ufHFZclQSeUGmxHGAiUFNcH29clQE0IGRcHFZe:ms0g)? I think that's a question worth exploring. In an age of ubiquitous smartphones, what does it mean to be more than that?

The answer from Apple's ad is: a computer is something you can do homework on. For many school students that's a Chromebook, because [they have one for class](https://www.education.act.gov.au/about-us/all-news-and-news-alerts/news-items/february-2019/chromebook-rollout-continues-into-2019). Chromebooks are perhaps the fulfilment of the dream of the dumb terminal; inexpensive gateways to the web they let you do email, write assignments collaboratively, and of course watch YouTube.

Where does the iPad fit in education? [Awkwardly](https://www.speirs.org/blog/2019/7/27/on-switching-from-ipad-to-chromebook-in-school). Apple seems to have rested on their laurels once again in education, and Google has basically stolen their lunch. Education needs hardwearing devices with rock solid software that require minimal management. They need backups. They need to be able to hand a child a device and have them sign in and all the student's work be ready to go. This is not any of the modern iPads.

If an iPad isn't for education, is it for work? Around the iPad 2, I noticed a small surge in interest amongst the 11" MacBook Air devotees for the iPad as a replacement. Since then I have felt interest drop off. [Not completely](https://www.macstories.net/author/viticci/) of course, but then it was never very large to begin with. But why?
