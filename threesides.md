[![Out Now: ThreeSides for iOS]({{ site.url }}/images/outnow.png)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/three-sides/id952654261?ls=1&mt=8)


## 你好, nǐhǎo, hello

Learning a new language is hard enough. What if you also have to learn a new writing system at the same time? ThreeSides is here to help.

Every ThreeSides card has three sides. Why three? When studying languages it can be helpful to not just have the word in the 'other' language and your language, but to also have some extra information:

* alternate scripts, for example Traditional and Simplified Chinese, or Kanji and Hiragana for Japanese,
* pronunciation tips or phonetics (IPA),
* transliteration or transcription into another script, such as Pinyin or Romaji,
* a third language, maybe a dialect or your native language,
* other things we haven't thought of!

So recycle your huge pile of flashcards, and get out your iPhone or iPad instead.

Many language students find themselves learning more than one language. Sometimes in classes that aren't in your native language!

In ThreeSides, you can have flashcards with your native language, your classroom language, and the language you're trying to learn, all on one card.

Never be afraid to learn!

## Help!

Vocabulary lists are treated as decks of cards in Three Sides. By default, Three Sides comes with a sample deck of the *Japanese Language Proficiency Test Level 5* vocabulary. Tap on the "JLPT5" deck name to start looking at cards.

Tap each side (pink rectangle) to hide or show it. Swipe right-to-left to show another card, and swipe left-to-right to show the previous card. Use the button at the top, or a left-edge-to-right swipe to go back to the list of decks.

You can get new words into Three Sides in a few ways.

### Importing Whole Decks

#### Getting the Right Format

Decks are stored in Three Sides as CSV files, with file names typically ending in ".csv". You can export CSV files from Microsoft Excel and Apple's Numbers applications. In most versions of Excel, you can choose "Comma separated values" from the format drop-down. In Numbers for Mac, the Export menu item in the File menu will give you a CSV option. In Numbers for iOS, choose "Open in Another App" after tapping the Share button, and then choose the CSV format option.

#### Importing the File

##### iOS (iPhone/iPad)

Simply choose "Three Sides" from the list of Apps in a share sheet.

##### Mac

If you have a new-ish Mac, and are using iCloud Drive, you can copy or save CSV files directly into iCloud where ThreeSides can see them. Simply open a new Finder window (click the smiley face in the dock) and choose "iCloud Drive" from the source list on the left. You should see a folder called ThreeSides. Any CSV files you copy or save into that folder will appear in Three Sides (if you are connected to the internet on your Mac and iOS device).

##### Windows, Linux, old Macs

###### Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, Sky Drive etc.

If you copy or save a CSV file into your cloud drive folder on your computer, and you have the companion iOS app, you can use the Share button in the iOS app to open the CSV file in Three Sides.

###### iTunes File Sharing (Windows, Mac)

You can copy CSV files into Three Sides using iTunes. Connect your iOS device to your computer and open iTunes. Select your device, and choose the "Applications"  or "Apps" section. Scroll down to the bottom and you should see a title called "File Sharing" and a list of Apps. Choose Three Sides from the list, and on the right a list of the decks in Three Sides will appear. Click the "Add" button to add a CSV file from your computer.

###### If All Else Fails: Email

If none of the other choices above have worked, you can always email the CSV file to yourself, open the email on your iOS device, and open the attachment in Three Sides.

### Making a New Deck

Press the "+" (plus) button on the top right corner of the list of decks to create a new deck. You can then edit it, as described below.

### Editing Decks

Swipe from right to left over any deck name in the list of decks to reveal the 'edit' button. Tap it to see a view where you can edit the raw text of your deck of cards.

Decks are edited as *comma-separated values* or CSV for short. Each line of text (row) represents one card. Cards are divided into three sides by commas. If you want a comma *inside* your side label, make sure you put your label in quotation marks. Here's two sample cards:

```
one,いち,一
"two: for some reason, this needs a long explanation",に,二
```

Be careful when typing your cards to use the regular plain comma: ",". Other characters which look or behave similarly, but won't work are:

* Chinese, Japanese or Korean comma: "、" 
* Full-width comma: "，" (also used in Chinese)
* Arabic comma: "، "

There's no maximum length to a card side in Three Sides. As the side has more text, the font size shrinks to fit it. If you put a lot of text on a card side, you might not be able to read it, so try and keep it short.

### Listening

Although ThreeSides is a mainly visual app, every effort has been made to make it fully accessible to VoiceOver. This means if you turn on VoiceOver (it can be found in the Settings app, under General ▶︎ Accessibility) your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch can read your cards to you, for any language VoiceOver supports.

## a² + b² = c², Pythagorean theorem, The square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
