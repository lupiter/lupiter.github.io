![Coming Soon: ThreeSides for iOS]({{ site.url }}/images/comingsoon.png)


## 你好, nǐhǎo, hello

Learning a new language is hard enough. What if you also have to learn a new writing system at the same time? ThreeSides is here to help.

Every ThreeSides card has three sides. One for your native language, one for a romanisation, and one for your target language.

So recycle your huge pile of flashcards, and get out your iPhone or iPad instead.

## three, tiga, telu

Many language students find themselves learning more than one language. Sometimes in classes that aren't in your native language!

In ThreeSides, you can have flashcards with your native language, your classroom language, and the language you're trying to learn, all on one card.

Never be afraid to learn!

## a² + b² = c², Pythagorean theorem, The square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. 

We're sure you'll find new and different ways to use ThreeSides that we never dreamed of. Let us know how ThreeSides has helped you on Twitter ([@sircathywise](http://twitter.com/sircathywise)) or leave an App Store review.
